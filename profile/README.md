## About
The chicken farming business is a highly promising venture, given the high demand for chicken meat and eggs in Indonesia. However, chicken farming carries a significant risk of loss due to diseases that affect chickens. According to one of the chicken producers in Central Java, PT. Tumbul Optimal Prima losses due to chicken diseases can reach around 81 million in 2021. So, how do we handle this risk and minimize losses due to chicken diseases? To address this issue, it is essential for farmers to understand how to prevent and manage chicken diseases early on. Therefore, we will develop an application to help chicken farmers in gaining a better understanding of the types of chicken diseases, their symptoms, prevention methods, and treatment procedures. This application will also help farmers directly detect diseases affecting their chickens and provide recommendations for suitable medication and the nearest places to purchase that.
